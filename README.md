# Gitpod + Wordpress + MariaDB

This repository is just an example how you can use Gitpod for developing themes, or plugins for Wordpress (+MariaDB as DB).

The setup consist of two simple Docker services, wordpress and MaraiDB.

Your WP theme files should be stored in the directory `mythemes`, which is linked to the Wordpress directory `/var/www/html/wp-content/themes`.

Improvements - please let me know!
